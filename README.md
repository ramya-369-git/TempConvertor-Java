Temperature Converter
A simple graphical user interface (GUI) Java application that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
This application uses the JFrame class from the javax.swing library to create a window for input and output. 
The user can enter the temperature in Celsius, and the app will display the converted temperature in Fahrenheit.
